# PyTorch Tutorials 2024

Welcome to my PyTorch Tutorials repository!

As I embark on my journey to learn PyTorch, I aim to share my insights and knowledge with the community through this repository. Whether you're a beginner or looking to deepen your understanding, I hope you find these resources valuable.

### What to Expect

- **Comprehensive Notebooks**: I will be creating detailed Jupyter notebooks to facilitate your learning process. These notebooks will cover various aspects of PyTorch, making it easier to grasp key concepts through hands-on examples.
  
- **Curated Tutorials**: The content will be based on the [PyTorch With Examples](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/pytorch_with_examples.html) tutorial, complemented by additional insights and materials that I will integrate.

- **Practical Project**: In addition to tutorials, I will undertake a practical project to demonstrate how to apply PyTorch techniques to real-world applications. This project entitled[Lidar and Camera Fusion for Object Detection](https://github.com/Jalilnkh/PyTorch-with-Examples-2024/blob/main/Project%3A%20Lidar%20and%20Camera%20Fusion%20for%20Object%20Detection.ipynb) aim to provide a concrete understanding of how to implement and optimize PyTorch models.

Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute. Your feedback and contributions are highly appreciated!

Happy learning!
